	"description": "A blatant hack of Gotlag's original Honk mod which changes the sounds to Deltic horns. Trains honk when stopping. And starting. And on command. This version fixes a Hotkey clash with Nexela's Picker Extended mod. If you are not using Picker Extended then you should continue to use Deltic Honk 0.15.1",
